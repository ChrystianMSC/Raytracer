# raytracer

Welcome to my Ray Tracer in a Weekend project! This project is a ray tracer implementation based on the book Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley. The goal of this project is to help me learn and obtain a foundational understanding of ray tracing and create a simple, yet functional, ray tracing renderer from scratch.
